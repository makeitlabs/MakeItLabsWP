Add a modal widget for Elementor Page Builder.

== Description ==

NOTE: Last tested with Wordpress 4.8.2 and Elementor 1.7.12
= No further develpment will be done. I'm happy to give the project to some one that can keep developing it :)

This plugin allows to create beautiful templates with and for Elementor Page Builder.

It will add a menu on your Wordpress Dashboard called Elementor Popups. There you can create
your popups using Elementor Pagebuilder.

It will also add a Widget in Elementor Pagebuilder to add a customizable button in your page.
Select the popup you want to show when button is clicked.
